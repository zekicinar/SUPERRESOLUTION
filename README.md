# SUPERRESOLUTION

In this folder, you will find examples about superresolution. For protection of reference blogâ€™s rights(TensorFlow 2.0 Computer Vision Cookbook and https://pyimagesearch.com/ ), I do not add images and weights which are given by them.You can find detailed information from 4th chapter in book and Adrian's blogs.
The first three notebooks are from PyimageSearch and the fourth one from the book. I just add some of results from my notebooks. Keywords and concepts of notebooks are given below :

1.)	Opencv_superresolution : resizing images with pretrained superresolution models with OpenCV

2.)	image_superresolution(SR) : train SRCNN model and compare results

3.)	pixel_shift: Pixel Shuffle Super Resolution, BSDS500 dataset,

4.)	CNN_superresolution: Super Resolution with CNN on cat-dog dataset
